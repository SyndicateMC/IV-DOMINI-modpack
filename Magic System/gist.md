## How does it work?
The magic system would center around the <ins>**Four Lords**</ins>, a school, or type of magic for each god. There will be rituals, praying, spellcasting, and other stuff.

## Spellcasting
I would use **Iron's Spells & Spellbooks** for the base of the magic system. All of the mod's original magic schools, spells, weapons, accessories, armors, mobs, structures, and specialty items have been removed, disable, or rendered unobtainable to provide a blank slate for me to work with.

There will be no spell leveling, only greater versions of spells (ie. a Gust spell and Greater Gust spell).

Spell Scrolls have been converted into *Spell Runes*, stone slates with a symbol etched into them to discern the school. Spellbooks have been converted into *Spell Tablets*, stone slates with gems embedded in them.
