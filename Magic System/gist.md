# How does it work?
The magic system would center around the <ins>**Four Lords**</ins>, a school, or type of magic for each god. There will be rituals, praying, spellcasting, and other stuff.

The four magics will be *Physical*, *Deathly*, *Emotional*, *Orderly*.

## Spellcasting
I would use **Iron's Spells & Spellbooks** for the base of the magic system. All of the mod's original magic schools, spells, weapons, accessories, armors, mobs, structures, and specialty items have been removed, disable, or rendered unobtainable to provide a blank slate for me to work with.

There will be no spell leveling, only greater versions of spells (ie. a Gust spell and Greater Gust spell).

Spell Scrolls have been converted into *Spell Runes*, stone slates with a symbol etched into them to discern the school. Spellbooks have been converted into *Spell Tablets*, stone slates with gems embedded in them.

Mana will be renamed to *Arcana*. Capacity of *Arcana* will be reduced to a base max of 10. *Arcana* will be gained through prayer and other things instead of it just regenerating passively. Spells will use a small amount of *Arcana*.

Spells will be obtained through rituals.

## Prayer
Prayer would consist of interacting with and then crouching or sitting by a statue.

There would be a statue for each god. Statues are made by placing two hardened stone types in a pillar, and then interacting with them with a chisel in the mainhand, and a gem (corresponding to the god you are making the statue of) in the offhand.

Then, by interacting with a statue, you would then start a timer of 60s. By sitting or crouching near the statue, the timer will deplete. When the timer reaches 0, your *Arcana* will be fully replenished and you will recieve a blessing corresponding to the god you prayed to. Cooldown between prayers is 10min.

Consistently praying to a certain god without praying to another will garner favor. Blessing level will increase with favor.

## Rituals
Rituals are preformed at altars.

By throwing certain materials on an altar, and then interacting with it, you can preform a ritual. 

Spells are obtained through rituals. You would first need to craft a few Blank Slates, these are made by putting three stone (types) and a chisle in a crafting interface. You would then put the slate on the altar, and with the addition of other items the altar would imbue the slate with magic, giving you a Spell Rune.
