# Spells for the Modpack
This file just contains ideas for spells that I want to add to the modpack. They will be catagorized based on the school they are a part of. I will give the gist of the themes of the spells, I may not follow them super closely just so there is more variety of spells.

Terms to note:
- DMG: normal damage.
- M-DMG: magic damage, pierces armor.

## Physical
Physical spells usually have to do with physically effecting terrain, forming physical barriers, or direct contact with something. Can also be associated with summoning storms and such.

## Emotional
Emotional spells usually have to do with support. Like applying a buff to a friend, and applying a negative effect to a foe.

## Orderly
Orderly spells usually have to do with some sort of imbuement, or maybe telekinesis.
