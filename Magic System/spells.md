# Spells for the Modpack
This file just contains ideas for spells that I want to add to the modpack. They will be catagorized based on the school they are a part of. I will give the gist of the themes of the spells, I may not follow them super closely just so there is more variety of spells.

Terms to note:
- DMG: normal damage.
- M-DMG: magic damage, pierces armor.

## Physical
Physical spells usually have to do with physically effecting terrain or forming physical barriers.

**Stomp:**
```
Stats:
- long cast
- 10s cooldown
- 2 arcana cost
- common

Info:
- Functions similarly to the stomp spell in base ISS.
- Does 5DMG.
```

## Deathly
Deathly spells usually have to do with direct damage or direct healing.

## Emotional
Emotional spells usually have to do with support.

## Orderly
Orderly spells usually have to do with some sort of imbuement, or maybe telekinesis.
