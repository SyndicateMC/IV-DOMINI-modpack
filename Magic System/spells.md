# Spells for the Modpack
This file just contains ideas for spells that I want to add to the modpack. They will be catagorized based on the school they are a part of. I will give the gist of the themes of the spells, I may not follow them super closely just so there is more variety of spells.

Terms to note:
- DMG: normal damage.
- M-DMG: magic damage, pierces armor.
- HP: health, health points.

Additional notes:
- The spell rarity system has been changed:
  - **Common -> Common**
  - **Uncommon -> Rare**
  - **Rare -> Epic**
  - **Legendary -> Epic**
  - **Legendary -> Flawless**
- Again, no spell leveling.
