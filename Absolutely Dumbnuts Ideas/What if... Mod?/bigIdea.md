# Main Idea
Instead of having this whole modpack be, well, a modpack, what if it were a mod?

This file will go into detail with how this would be executed, if it were to be.

## Content
The idea for this mod is that it will take the more subtle, custom magic system in the modpack and turn it into a subtle magic mod. The main focus is for the magic to be present, but not "in-your-face". Benefits from magic will be small additions to the player's mind, body, and soul; not some overconvuluted spellcasting system or use of massive altar setups to appease gods (actually, scratch that last part).
