# Main Idea
Instead of having this whole modpack be, well, a modpack, what if it were a mod?

This file will go into detail with how this would be executed, if it were to be.

This could also be used for ideas for the main modpack, as maybe implementing these ideas into that would be easier.

## Gist
The idea for this mod is that it will take the more subtle, custom magic system in the modpack and turn it into a subtle magic mod. The main focus is for the magic to be present, but not "in-your-face". Benefits from magic will be small additions to the player's mind, body, and soul; not some overconvoluted spellcasting system or use of wands.

Being an active participator in the magics will be rewarding, but just simply praying to a lord once a day will still provide benefits that one should not shun.

Generally, I want to take some inspiration from **Fear & Hunger** and **Darkwood**, when it comes to the gods system, and leveling system.

## How it Would Work
Similarly in the modpack, there would be altars and statues. There would be a whole reworked favor system, gaining favor with a lord dependant on the actions of a player. Doing an favored action (other than prayer) repeatedly will lessen the reward of favor from a lord (ie. repeatedly sacrificing the same material to gain favor; it will diminish exponentially until zero). Value of an item is accounted for.

The first order of business is prayer, this can be done at respective statues of the lords, which can be found in villages (one lord assigned to village, statues would be found in churches and certain houses) and one-off structure setpieces (temples, ruins, ruined temples, large statues). Prayer requires the player to crouch and then interact with a statue, which will put the player in a kneeling position as they have to wait for 10 seconds for the prayer to conclude. Consistent prayer with a single lord, and no other, will garner more favor. You can pray once per day. Missing days will reduce favor bonus, praying to another lord will reduce favor bonus greatly.
