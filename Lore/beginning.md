In the beginning, there was nothing; and then, there was something.

Four gods, there were four gods. Let's call them the **Four Lords**.

The first one, we'll call the **Lord of Stone**. He will be the god of physicality. He will determine damage, and the physical state of something. 

He gives others a body, a body to be used as a shell for what is to come. His name is **Maht**.

The second one, we'll call the **Lord of Salt**. He will be the god of life, and of death. He will determine who, and what is alive, and who is not. 

He gives others a life, a life to be lived. His name is **Kuolev**.

The third one, we'll call the **Lord of Clay**. He will be the god of the mind. He will determine the ability of others to think, feel, and act. 

He gives others a mind, a mind to be molded by experience. His name is **T'unn**.

The fourth, and final one, we'll call the **Lady of Metal**. She will be the goddess of order. She will determine what things are able to do. 

She gives others a purpose, a purpose in their life. Her name is **Y'hita**.

Now; within this something, the world was made.

**Maht** formed the earth. He molded the land and water into the shapes that exist today.

And within this world, he formed the first vessels.

**Kuolev** gave life to these vessels. He breathed life into them.

He created the first animals, plants, and animals.

**T'unn** took these now living beings, and gave them a mind.

These beings then roamed. They dispersed themselves around the world.

**Y'hita** then gave them a reason. She gave them their purpose.

Plants would grow, and spread, and die, and grow again.

Animals would eat these plants, and grow, and spread, and be eaten, and die.

Humans would be given a true, and ultimate purpose. To dominate the lands, the animals, and the plants; and devote their lives to them, the **Four Lords**,
